# Binary Search Tree-Based Dictionary

## Description:
In this project, I developed a highly efficient Dictionary Abstract Data Type (ADT) in C++. Utilizing a Binary Search Tree (BST) as the underlying data structure, the program efficiently manages key-value pairs, supporting operations such as insertion, deletion, and search. This implementation showcases my proficiency in advanced data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming in C++. The project emphasizes my ability to optimize data handling and searching algorithms, essential skills in software development.
